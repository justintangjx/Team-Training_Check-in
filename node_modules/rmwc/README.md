# RMWC - React Material Web Components

A React (15 / 16) wrapper for Material Design (Web) Components v0.32.0
[https://jamesmfriedman.github.io/rmwc/](https://jamesmfriedman.github.io/rmwc/)

## Recent updates

RMWC is moving towards a direct implementation with MDC's Foundation classes. This means direct code reuse from the material-components-web implementation which will result in better performance, reliability, less bugs, and easier releases for RMWC. These will be rolled out a few at a time every release and will contain minimal breaking changes.

Patch 1.4.1

* Fixes issues with SSR and foundation components
* Contains a workaround for a MDC bug in Slider
* Contains fixes in Select for React 15.x.

MDC has been upgraded to 0.32.0

* Slider

  * Implemented the foundation adapter.
  * BREAKING CHANGE: onInput and onChange now use MDC's custom events and have evt.detail.value instead of evt.target.value.

* IconToggle

  * Implemented the foundation adapter.
  * BREAKING CHANGE: onChange now uses MDC's custom event and has evt.detail.isOn instead of evt.target.value.

* Chip

  * Implemented the foundation adapter.
  * Updated to add chip selected state.
  * Added additional custom event handlers from the foundation

* Ripple
  * Implemented the foundation adapter.
  * Corrected issues with unbounded ripples

Notes from 0.31.0

* Feature: ChipIcon
  There are now leading and trailing icons for the chip component. This resulted in a minor breaking change, you now have to wrap the text inside of your chip with a ChipText component. See the docs.
* Feature: CardPrimaryAction
  This makes the primary area of a card clickable with a ripple.

If you are updating from 1.1.x to MDC 0.30.0

* Feature: Chip
  There is a new Chip and ChipSet component for you to use.
* Feature: Standard and Box Select
  There are new stylings for the Select component
* Feature: ButtonIcon
  You can now use the ButtonIcon component to render an Icon inside of a Button
* Breaking Change: cssOnly Select Removal
  MDC has completely removed cssOnly selects. If you relied on the cssOnly Select for mobile, guidance is to wrap the select in your own component that returns a standard CSS select.
* Breaking Change: Menu
  MDC renamed SimpleMenu has been renamed to Menu. In addition to this, RMWC uses the "Simple"Component naming convention and has added a SimpleMenu component that manages state. To upgrade, just rename your exising SimpleMenu components to Menu, or see the new SimpleMenu usage and adjust accordingly.
* Breaking Change: Cards
  MDC has completely reworked their card layouts to be much more minimal. Guidance on this is to use your own CSS to style the content appropriately.
* Breaking Change: Dark Theme
  The automatic dark theme styling and themeDark props have been entirely removed from MDC. Guidance on this is to use your own CSS to style things in a dark theme context.

## Goals

* To create the thinnest, lightest, and spec compliant wrapper around Google
  Material Design Components for the Web
  [https://material.io/components/web/](https://material.io/components/web/)
* To utilize the Foundation javascript classes and expose their api for
  consumption
* To be as unobtrusive and sensible as possible.

## Installation

Required steps

* `npm i rmwc --save` or `yarn add rmwc`
* [material-components-web](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web) should be installed automatically as a peer dependency. Include `node_modules/material-components-web/dist/material-components-web.min.css` in your project via your method of choice (using a link tag, a css-loader, etc.).

Optional steps

* If you would like to use the default **Roboto font**:
  * add `<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:300,400,500" rel="stylesheet" />`
  * add the class `mdc-typography` to the body `<body className="mdc-typography">...</body>`
* If you would like to use the **material-icons** font:
  * add `<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons" rel="stylesheet">`
* Add global settings by using the optional `<RMWCProvider />` component at the root of your project. See the 'Provider' section for more info.
