What was good:
- Great improvement in UI since your presentation!
- good use of react router
- nice use for recharts
- good that you focused on understanding React design patterns/fundamentals instead of fancy UI!

What could be improved:
- See inline comments in this commit
- should clear input box after submission
- can differentiate different routes by giving each page a title
- try toggling active/inactive property of submit button
- can remove linting errors
- conditional rendering logic can be refactored to be more common-sensical
- correct use of controlled components
- should refactor components with duplicate code into a single component
- there is a bug in your application now - when you change tabs between what was awesome and what to work on, the component is re-rendered, and state is lost. This should be fixed when make a POST request to an express server in the form submission, and when you load the feedback items from your server
